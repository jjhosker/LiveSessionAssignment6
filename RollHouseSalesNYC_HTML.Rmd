# R Markdown Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for Live Assignement #6 for MSDS 6306-402: Doing Data Science at SMU. 

Part of this code was taken from Benjamin Reddy and taken from pages 49-50
of O'Neil and Schutt

# R Libraries Required
  • require(gdata)
  
  • require(plyr) #Added by Monnie McGee
  
  • required(car) # Added by James Hosker 

Install the gdata, plyr and car packages and load in to R.
  • library(car)
  • library(plyr)
  • library(gdata)

```{r}
library(car)
library(plyr)
## library(gdata)
```

# Data Files Required to Load and Basic Format of Data 
  • Change directory to directory where your uncleaned data file rather than using our directory below.
  
  • Again our unlceaned data file is called rollingsales_brooklyn.csv.
  
  • We load the uncleaned data skipping over the first four lines of the file, which is commentary information.  The data frame is called "bk".
  
  • Our cleaned data file is called CLEANEDrollingsales_brooklyn.csv.  which we will save later in this writeup.
  
  • Finally we provide some basic formatting information on the data frame with the head, summary and str functions.

```{r}
# So, save the file as a csv and use read.csv instead
bk <- read.csv("C:/Users/JHosker/Documents/Rproj/LiveSessionAssignment6/rollingsales_brooklyn.csv",skip=4,header=TRUE)

## Check the data
head(bk)
summary(bk)
str(bk) # Very handy function!
```

# Cleaning and Reformatting of Data
  • First using the "[^[:digit:]]", we are filtering out all characters in each entry that has number (sales.price, gross.square.feet & land.square.feet) and save the digits, we then save the data as numerics and save them as new columns in the "bk" data frame as sales.price.n. gross.sqft, & land.sqft, respectively.
  
  •  We change the labels that we will use to lower case.   

  •  Finally to filter the names in the building.class.category, We resave the category names as characters so we can used them later in labeling the data. 

```{r}
## clean/format the data with regular expressions
## More on these later. For now, know that the
## pattern "[^[:digit:]]" refers to members of the variable name that
## start with digits. We use the gsub command to replace them with a blank space.

## We create a new variable that is a "clean' version of sale.price.
## And sale.price.n is numeric, not a factor.

## Get rid of leading digits and any letter characters and convert remaining number string to numeric
bk$SALE.PRICE.N <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", bk$SALE.PRICE))
count(is.na(bk$SALE.PRICE.N))

names(bk) <- tolower(names(bk)) # make all variable names lower case
## Get rid of leading digits, get rid of characters and convert number string to numeric
bk$gross.sqft <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", bk$gross.square.feet))
bk$land.sqft <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", bk$land.square.feet))
bk$year.built <- as.numeric(as.character(bk$year.built))

## Change building.class.category to character string from integer
bk$building.class.category <- as.character(bk$building.class.category)

```

# Filter the Data, Remove NAs and Zeros.  Focus on Family Dwellings
  • First thing that we do is we create a subset (called "familydwell"") of the data frame "bk" to look at only the one, two and three family dwelling data as a a separte data frame with only five columns: building.class.category","sale.price.n", "gross.sqft","land.sqft" and "year.built".
  
  • We then remove (omit) all "NA" data in these three building classifications under "familydwell".

  •  We divide the "sales.price.n" column by 1,000 so we can better display the data around sales without any exponential labels.  We will then label all graphs with sales in $000s.

  • From sale.price.n data, we remove all values < $500.

  • From year built data, we remove all zeros.

  • From gross.sqft and land.sqft, we checked for values less than 100 sqft but found none after we removed the NAs.  

  • We relabel the the three main building categories that have too many spaces and characters below in order to better display them in boxplots, plots, histograms, and q-q plots:
    - "01  ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS                    " becomes "1 One Dwelling"
    - "02  TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS                    " becomes "2 Two Dwelling"
    - "03  THREE FAMILY DWELLINGS                  " becomes "3 Three Dwelling"

  • We save two cleanded data files:
    - • Cleaned Dataset on data frame bk:  CLEANED_bk_rollsales_brooklyn.csv
              -  This is the orginal date with the cleaning that we orginally received in the 
                 code provided in class.  Filtering data using "[^[:digit:]]" and omitting NAs. 
    - • Cleaned Dateset on data frame familydwell using our code:  CLEANED_familydwelling.csv
              -  This is the CLEANED_rolingsales_brookly.csv with some additional filters for our analysis. 
                 We filter out only One, Two and Three Family Dwelling Homes.
                 Additional cleaning includes removing zeros in year.built, removing sales purchase data 
                 below $500 and other cleaning documented in the HTML file.

# Plots and Interpretation of Data/Plots

## 1. Sales Price for All Family Dwellings
  • In this first set of plots, we investigate sales price using the following R functions:  "summary" (summary statistics), "boxplot"", "hist" (histogram), and "qqnorm"" (Q-Q Plot using normal distribution).

  • Establish Figure Number variable for numbering of figures.
  
## Analysis: BLA BLA BLA

```{r}
## Summary Statistics for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
cat("Summary of Sales Price ($000s) for 1,2 & 3 Family Dwellings")
summary(familydwell$sale.price.n)

## Sales Price:  Create BoxPlot for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
boxplot(familydwell$sale.price.n~familydwell$building.class.category,
        xlim=c(0,4),ylab="$ Price 000s", 
        main="Fig.1: Sales Price BoxPlot of One, Two and Three \n Family Dwellings Individually")

## Sales Price:  Create Histogram for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
hist(familydwell$sale.price.n, xlab="One to Three Family $ Price in 000s",
     ylab="Frequency",
     main="Fig.2: Sales Price Histogram of One, Two and Three \n Family Dwellings Combined")

## Sales Price:  Create Q-Q Plot using a normal distribution for One, Two 
##   and Three Family Dwellings Combined
qqnorm(familydwell$sale.price.n, xlab="Sales Price Theoretical Quantiles of One, Two \n and Three Family Dwellings Combined",
       ylab="Sample Quantiles in $ Price 000s",
       main="Fig.3: Normal Q-Q Plot of Sales Price for One, \n Two and Three Family Dwellings")

```

## 2. Sales Price vs. Gross Square Feet AND Sales Price vs. Land Square Feet For All Family Dwellings
  • In this second set of plots, we investigate sales price vs. gross sqft using the "plot"" (scatterplot) command.

  • We use the entire data set and then filter out the outliers > 10k in gross sqft to get a more accurate intrepretation of the distribution.  This removes only two samples.

  • For sales price vs. land square feet, we show the full data and the data filter outliers > 15k square feet, so we can see the distribution of the plot better.  This removes only one sample.
  
# Analysis:  

## 1. We can generally see that the sales prices increases as the gross square footage increases.  The same is true for sales price vs. land square footage.   

## 2. Sales Price goes form $1K to $19.88 Mill with median of $750k and mean of $929.1k.  The Q1 (25%) to Q3 (75%) distribuiton iss from $495K to $1,125k.

## 3. Gross sqft has a min of 324 sqft and a mximum of 20.64k sqft.  The mean is 2201 sqft and the median is 2080 sqft.  The Q1 (25%) to Q3 (75%) distribuiton is from 1540 to 2700 sqft.

## 4. Land sqft has a min of 250 sqft and a mximum of 63.6k sqft.  The mean is 2338 sqft and the median is 2000 sqft.  The Q1 (25%) to Q3 (75%) distribuiton is from 1800 to 2500 sqft.

```{r}
## Summary Statistics for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
cat("Summary of Sales Price ($000s) for 1,2 & 3 Family Dwellings")
summary(familydwell$sale.price.n)
cat("Summary of Gross Sqft for 1,2 & 3 Family Dwellings")
summary(familydwell$gross.sqft)
cat("Summary of Land Sqft for 1,2 & 3 Family Dwellings")
summary(familydwell$land.sqft)

## Graph Sales Price vs. Gross Sqft for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
plot(familydwell$sale.price.n,familydwell$gross.sqft,
     xlab="Sales Price in 000s", ylab = "Gross Sqft",
     main="Fig.4: Sales Price vs. Gross Sqft for 1 to 3 \n Family Dwellings")

## Graph Sales Price vs. Gross Sqft for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
## We filter out outliers above 10K gross sqft which is two samples: 
## 10.424k and 20.457k gross sqft
count(familydwell$gross.sqft[familydwell$gross.sqft > 10000])
plot(familydwell$sale.price.n,familydwell$gross.sqft,
     xlab="Sales Price in 000s", ylab = "Gross Sqft",ylim=c(1,10000),
     main="Fig.5: Sales Price vs. Gross Sqft for 1 to 3 \n Family Dwelling (< 10K gross sqft)")

## Graph Sales Price vs. Land Sqft for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
plot(familydwell$sale.price.n,familydwell$land.sqft,
     xlab="Sales Price in 000s", ylab = "Land Sqft",
     main="Fig.6: Sales Price vs. Land Sqft for 1 to 3 \n Family Dwelling")

## Graph Sales Price vs. Land Sqft for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
## We filter out outliers above 15k which is two samples: 42.5 and 68.6k samples
count(familydwell$land.sqft[familydwell$land.sqft > 15000])
plot(familydwell$sale.price.n,familydwell$land.sqft,
     xlab="Sales Price in 000s", ylab = "Land Sqft", ylim=c(1,15000),
     main="Fig.7: Sales Price vs. Land Sqft for 1 to 3 \n Family Dwelling (< 15k land sqft)")

```

## 3.  Sales Price vs. Year Built For All Family Dwellings
  • In this third set of plots, we investigate sales using the "plot"" (scatterplot) command.
  
  • For sales price vs. year built, we set the x-axis to year 1800 to 2015 (the max year in the data frame).  This removes no samples.

## Analysis:  BLA BLA BLA.

```{r}
## Summary Statistics for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
cat("Summary of Year Built for 1,2 & 3 Family Dwellings")
summary(familydwell$year.built)

## Individual Graph Sales Price vs. Year Built for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
plot(familydwell$year.built,familydwell$sale.price.n, xlab = "Year Built", 
     ylab="Sales Price in 000s",xlim=c(1800,2017),
     main="Fig.8: Year Built vs. Sales Price for 1 to 3 \n Family Dwelling")

```

## 4.  Year Built, Gross Square Feet Land Square Feet For All Family Dwellings
  • In this fourth set of plots, we investigate these elements using the "boxplot"" and "hist" (histogram) commands.
  • For gross and land square feet we fitler out outliers greater than 15K, which eliminates only one sample for gross square footage and two from land square footage.
  
## Analysis:  BLA BLA BLA.

```{r}
## Summary Statistics for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
cat("Summary of Year Built for 1,2 & 3 Family Dwellings")

  xlab="Gross Sqft for One to Three Family Dwell", ylab="Frequency",
  main="Fig.11: Histogram of Gross Sqft for One, Two and Three \n Family Dwellings Combined (< 15K Gross Sqft)")

## Land Sqft:  Create BoxPlot for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
## We filter out outliers above 15k which is two samples: 42.5 and 68.6k samples
count(familydwell$land.sqft[familydwell$land.sqft > 15000])
boxplot(familydwell$land.sqft~familydwell$building.class.category,
        xlim=c(0,4),ylab="Land Sqft", ylim=c(1,15000),
        main="Fig.12: Land Sqft BoxPlot of One, Two and Three \n Family Dwellings (< 15K Land Sqft)")

     main="Fig.13: Histogram of Land Sqft for One, Two and Three \n Family Dwellings Combined (< 15K Land Sqft)")

```

## 5.  Sales Price for Each Individual Dwelling (One, Two, Three)
  • In this fifth set of plots, we investigate these elements with the "hist" (histogram) and "qqnorm" (q-q plot) command of only sales price data for each individual category of family dwellings.
  
  • We could also do the same for other variables but stop here.  Other variables are gross square feet; year built; and land per square feet.
