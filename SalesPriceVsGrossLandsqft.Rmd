# R Markdown Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for Live Assignement #6 for MSDS 6306-402: Doing Data Science at SMU. 

This code loads the CLEANED_familydwelling.csv, which is the cleaned data and graphs sales price vs. gross sqft and sales price vs. land sqft. 

# R Libraries Required
  • require(gdata)
  
  • require(plyr) #Added by Monnie McGee
  
  • required(car) # Added by James Hosker 

Install the gdata, plyr and car packages and load in to R.
  • library(car)
  • library(plyr)
  • library(gdata)

```{r}
library(car)
library(plyr)
## library(gdata)

```

# Data Files Required to Load and Basic Format of Data 
  • Here we load the filtered data on one, two and three family dwellings.

  • For more information on how the data was filtered see the document RollHousSalesNYC_HTML.html in this repository.
  
```{r}
# So, save the file as a csv and use read.csv instead
familydwell <- read.csv("C:/Users/JHosker/Documents/Rproj/LiveSessionAssignment6/CLEANED_familydwelling.csv",header=TRUE)

```

## Sales Price vs. Gross Square Feet AND Sales Price vs. Land Square Feet For All Family Dwellings
  • In this set of plots, we investigate sales price vs. gross sqft using the "plot"" (scatterplot) command.

  • We use the entire data set and then filter out the outliers > 10k in gross sqft to get a more accurate intrepretation of the distribution.  This removes only two samples.

  • For sales price vs. land square feet, we show the full data and the data filter outliers > 15k square feet, so we can see the distribution of the plot better.  This removes only two samples.
  
# Analysis:  

## 1. We can generally see that the sales prices increases as the gross square footage increases.  The same is true for sales price vs. land square footage.   

## 2. Sales Price goes form $1K to $19.88 Mill with median of $750k and mean of $929.1k.  The Q1 (25%) to Q3 (75%) distribuiton iss from $495K to $1,125k.

## 3. Gross sqft has a min of 324 sqft and a mximum of 20.64k sqft.  The mean is 2201 sqft and the median is 2080 sqft.  The Q1 (25%) to Q3 (75%) distribuiton is from 1540 to 2700 sqft.

## 4. Land sqft has a min of 250 sqft and a mximum of 63.6k sqft.  The mean is 2338 sqft and the median is 2000 sqft.  The Q1 (25%) to Q3 (75%) distribuiton is from 1800 to 2500 sqft.

## Graph Sales Price vs. Gross Sqft for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
plot(familydwell$sale.price.n,familydwell$gross.sqft,
     xlab="Sales Price in 000s", ylab = "Gross Sqft",

## Graph Sales Price vs. Gross Sqft for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
## We filter out outliers above 10K gross sqft which is two samples: 
## 10.424k and 20.457k gross sqft
count(familydwell$gross.sqft[familydwell$gross.sqft > 10000])
plot(familydwell$sale.price.n,familydwell$gross.sqft,
     xlab="Sales Price in 000s", ylab = "Gross Sqft",ylim=c(1,10000),
     main="Fig.2: Sales Price vs. Gross Sqft for 1 to 3 \n Family Dwelling (< 10K gross sqft)")

## Graph Sales Price vs. Land Sqft for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
plot(familydwell$sale.price.n,familydwell$land.sqft,
     xlab="Sales Price in 000s", ylab = "Land Sqft",
     main="Fig.3: Sales Price vs. Land Sqft for 1 to 3 \n Family Dwelling")

## Graph Sales Price vs. Land Sqft for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings Combined
## We filter out outliers above 15k which is two samples: 42.5 and 68.6k samples
count(familydwell$land.sqft[familydwell$land.sqft > 15000])
plot(familydwell$sale.price.n,familydwell$land.sqft,
     xlab="Sales Price in 000s", ylab = "Land Sqft", ylim=c(1,15000),
     main="Fig.4: Sales Price vs. Land Sqft for 1 to 3 \n Family Dwelling (< 15k land sqft)")
